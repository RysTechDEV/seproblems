**Title**: Enhancing Problem-Solving Approaches for Neurodivergent Individuals Like Myself

**Context**: As a neurodivergent individual with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's syndrome, I often encounter challenges with conventional problem-solving methodologies. Traditional approaches tend to overlook the unique cognitive processing styles and stress management needs that come with neurodivergence. These frameworks often fail to address my difficulties in multitasking, organizational skills, and managing anxiety in high-pressure environments. Research shows that many neurodivergent individuals, including myself, face similar challenges, particularly in group settings where complex problems can feel overwhelming and difficult to tackle.

**Defining the Problem**: The central issue is the lack of inclusive frameworks and methodologies designed to accommodate the cognitive diversity of neurodivergent individuals like me. Current problem-solving approaches often lead to increased stress and feelings of overwhelm, making it hard to break down complex problems into manageable parts or engage in effective solutions.

**Objective**: My goal is to develop an inclusive problem-solving methodology specifically tailored to neurodivergent individuals like myself. This approach will help break down large problems into manageable components while minimizing overwhelm and promoting a structured, stress-free environment.

**Components of the Solution**:

1. **Inclusivity and Guidelines**: 
   
   - Develop inclusivity guidelines that cater to my needs and those of other neurodivergent individuals. This includes clear and direct communication, sensory accommodations, and structured environments conducive to learning and problem-solving, such as quiet spaces and visual aids.

2. **SMART Goals**: 
   
   - Implement SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) for sub-problems, with built-in breaks to prevent burnout. For example, I might set a goal like "Complete the first draft of the project outline within one week, with breaks every 30 minutes."

3. **Theoretical Framework**: 
   
   - Develop a theoretical framework that leverages my cognitive strengths as a neurodivergent individual, drawing on strength-based and neurodiversity models to celebrate diverse thinking.

4. **Conclusive Research and Documentation**: 
   
   - Conduct research to document how this methodology supports neurodivergent individuals, using qualitative and quantitative methods, including personal experiences and interviews with other neurodivergent individuals.

5. **Graph Structure for Difficulty-Based Problem Solving**: 
   
   - Utilize graph structures to visually represent related problems based on difficulty levels. This will help me and others systematically tackle sub-problems without feeling overwhelmed by complexity.

6. **PARA Structure Implementation**: 
   
   - Apply the PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) organizational framework to help me keep problem-solving clear and organized, ensuring easy access to materials and resources.

**Outcome**: The methodology aims to provide neurodivergent individuals like myself with a structured, inclusive problem-solving framework. By emphasizing breaks, SMART goals, and structured environments, the solution will reduce stress and increase effectiveness in tackling complex challenges. Ultimately, the initiative seeks to empower individuals like me to engage in innovative problem-solving while collaborating with professionals and neurodivergent communities.
